# NFLSCORES

This is a simple command-line utility which scrapes all of the NFL scores
and dumps them to the terminal in CSV format. This utility was written over
a weekend for a friend, and will likely not see active development again
unless somebody opens an issue.

## Usage

Simply type `nflscores` after compiling the binary. If somebody actually
sees this project and would like me to write better documentation, open an
issue. I'd be happy to write something if it would actually be of use.
